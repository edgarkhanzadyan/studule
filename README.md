# STU-expansions

What does S-T-U stand for?

## What This Is

This is the source code for the three-word thingies that randomly appear in the header of the [studule.mybluemix.net](https://studule.mybluemix.net) website. Examples include:

- Safe Technical University
- Satan's Tanking University
- Save The Uranus
- Ser Tam Urishin
- Serious Terrible Undertaker
- Sexiest Team Undefined
- Shoot The Usuph
- Silly Trolls University
- Slap The Unicorn
- Slovak Technical University
- Super Tolerant Ukrainian

## How to Contribute

Add your own expansion to [STU-MEANINGS.js](STU-MEANINGS.js), then send us a pull request! **If you think of multiple possibilities, please submit them as separate PRs**, as we may like some but not others.

Some other suggestions:

* Be meaningful. Three random words is not good enough.
* Be funny. This is very subjective, we realize, so try not to take it personally if we don't get it.
* Be novel. If your expansion starts with "Studule" the other two words better be pretty great.
* Avoid hyphenation, especially "non-". Yes, there are some in there already. Sorry.
* Use actual words. You can't just make up random new words. Unless they're really good.
* Avoid names of people and products (other than Studule ;-))
* Avoid expansions that are gendered, sexual, aggressive, or violent. We are a diverse, positive place.

This is a schedule for students. You can easily organize your days and manage your time more efficiently by using studule. It is still in development so if you want to contribute in any way, please feel free to open a pull request.
